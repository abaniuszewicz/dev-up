# DevUp - app for matching team members :rocket:
> In process of building an app, finding the right team members is the hardest thing of them all
>
> &mdash; _me, just now_

What if I told you that we decided to tackle down that complexity, so that you can focus on what's truly imporant: the project itself. Whether you're a solo-q player looking for the rest of the team, you're trying to find a temporarily replacement for a colleague that _rzucił wszystko i wyjechał w Bieszczady_, or you're just looking for someone that could bring your $1M worth app idea to life &mdash; we got you covered.

Just login, let us know what you're up to, and let us do our magic.
